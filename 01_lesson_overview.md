# NODEBOTS LESSON 1 OVERVIEW

### Welcome to NodeBots | who we are, what we want this to be, etc.
- JS and Hardware enthusiasts looking to learn by building bots
- The Arduino learning model
	- learn by discovery and tinkering
	
### BOILERPLATE | what you'll need to get started
- HARDWARE
	- laptop (preferably a mac, but whatevs)
	- arduino (if you have one)
	- other hardware (LEDs, breadboard, wires, etc. if you have it)
- SOFTWARE
	- node
	- johnny-five
	- arduino software
	- git would be helpful

**SPEND TIME GETTING PEOPLE UP AND RUNNING AS NEEDED**

### ARDUINO/ELECTRONIC BASICS | the basics of hardware
*I would like to have visual examples or quick experiments if possible*

-  ELECTRONICS
	- how electricity works
		- volts, amps, and ohms
		- resistance, current, and pressure
		- closed loop and moving electrons
- ARDUINO BASICS
	- what is a microcontroller?
	- board anatomy
		- digital (PWM)
		- analog
		- power and ground
		- reset button
		- pin 13 and status LED
	- the breadboard
		- how it works

### NODE AND JOHNNY-FIVE | using JS to control hardware
- WHY NODE AND WHAT ARE NODEBOTS EVEN?
- WRITING A BLINKING LIGHT SCRIPT
	- and then altering it to work differently
	- maybe increase the speed, brightness, use a button, etc
	- maybe it takes photo resistor input
